`primarySwatch`

- Create a custom:

```Dart
MaterialColor myColor = MaterialColor(0xFF880E4F, color);
```

- Create a map:

```Dart
Map<int, Color> color = {
    50:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .1),
    100:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .2),
    200:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .3),
    300:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .4),
    400:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .5),
    500:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .6),
    600:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .7),
    700:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .8),
    800:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, .9),
    900:Color.fromRGBO(4,131,184, 1),
}
```

- Use:

```Dart
primarySwatch: myColor
```
